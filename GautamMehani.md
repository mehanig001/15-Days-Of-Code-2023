# GAUTAM MEHANI - Vision 15 Days of Code Log

Welcome to my 15-day coding challenge! This challenge is designed to help me improve my coding skills and tackle coding problems daily.

## Day 1: Learning STL and Codeforces Practice

- Watched 4 informative lectures on the Standard Template Library (STL) from the LUV YouTube channel
  - 1st was basic overview of stl containers and algorithms
  - 2nd was implementation of vector, pairs, vector of vector, pair of pair, vector of pairs
  - 3rd was about iterators basics
  - 4th was about iterators using auto keyword

 Here is the link of code which I practised to learn vector I put all the things which I already knew or which I knew today <br>
