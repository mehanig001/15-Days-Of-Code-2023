# GAUTAM MEHANI - Vision 15 Days of Code Log

Welcome to my 15-day coding challenge! This challenge is designed to help me improve my coding skills and tackle coding problems daily.

## Day 1: Learning STL and Codeforces Practice
## 29 Aug 2023 <br>

### Submission Link for Codeforces
I tried two questions but I wasn't able to successfully submit the soln but soon I will try to fix the errors <br>
- [Submission Link](https://codeforces.com/submissions/GautamMehani) <br> 
Individual submission link <br> 
- [Sequence Game](https://codeforces.com/contest/1862/submission/221007003)<br>
- [Good Arrays](https://codeforces.com/contest/1856/submission/220942840)<br>

Watched 4 informative lectures on the Standard Template Library (STL) from the LUV YouTube     channel
  - 1st was basic overview of stl containers and algorithms
  - 2nd and 3rd was implementation of vector, pairs, vector of vector, pair of pair, vector of     pairs
  - 4th was about iterators basics
  - 5th was about iterators using auto keyword

Here is the link of code which I practised to learn vector and pairs I put all the things which I already knew or which I learned today <br>
