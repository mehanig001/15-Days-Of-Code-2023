# GAUTAM MEHANI - Vision 15 Days of Code Log

Welcome to my 15-day coding challenge! This challenge is designed to help me improve my coding skills and tackle coding problems daily.

## Learning [STL](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLauivoElc3gh3RCiQA82MDI-gJfXQQVnn&si=h_WPJhHIPX6WYbZb) and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/GautamMehani) Practice
##  Day 1 : 29 Aug 2023 <br>

#### Submission Link for Codeforces :-
I tried two questions but I wasn't able to successfully submit the soln but soon I will try to fix the errors <br>
- [Submission Link](https://codeforces.com/submissions/GautamMehani) <br> 
Individual submission link <br> 
- [Sequence Game](https://codeforces.com/contest/1862/submission/221007003)<br>
- [Good Arrays](https://codeforces.com/contest/1856/submission/220942840)<br>

Watched 5 informative lectures on the Standard Template Library (STL) from the LUV YouTube channel
  - 1st was basic overview of stl containers and algorithms
  - 2nd and 3rd was implementation of vector, pairs, vector of vector, pair of pair, vector of     pairs
  - 4th was about iterators basics
  - 5th was about iterators using auto keyword

Here is the link of code which I practised to learn vector and pairs I put all the things which I already knew or which I learned today <br>

## Day 2 : 30 Aug 2023 <br>

Watched next two lectures of STL i.e. L-6 and L-7 of STL bu LUV YouTube channel and learned maps, unordered_map, and multi maps
Here is the link in which I practised map container in STL and celebrated Rakshabandhan festival.

## Day 3 : 31 Aug 2023 <br>
Watched next three lectures of STL i.e. L-7, L-8 and L-9 of STL bu LUV YouTube channel and learned set, unordered_set, and multiset 
Here is the link in which I practised set in STL. <br>

## Day 4 : 01 Sep 2023 <br>
I went Satna with my family so my whole day was spent in travelling and that is why I couldn't practised CP. <br>

## Day 5 : 02 Sep 2023 <br>
The problem Good Arrays which I left unsubmitted in day 1 finally got submitted when I tried it with another logic after watching soln here is the link 
[Good Arrays CF](https://codeforces.com/contest/1856/submission/221561175)<br>

Watched next  lecture of STL i.e. L-10 of STL bu LUV YouTube channel which was about nesting of containers in STL and solved a question in which I learned to use multiset whenever we do not wnat to remove duplicate data <br>

## Day 6 : 03 Sep 2023 <br>
##### BACK TO MANIT
After celebreating Rakshbandhan at my home today I returned back to the MANIT since my ticket wasn't confirmed I got tired in 12 hrs journey but 
Watched next two lectures of STL i.e. L-11 and L-12 of STL bu LUV YouTube channel and learned basics of Stacks and Queues and done a question of check the given string of parenthesis is valid or not. <br><br>
Here is the link in which I practised Stack And Queue container in STL. <br>
