# GAUTAM MEHANI - Vision 15 Days of Code Log

Welcome to my 15-day coding challenge! This challenge is designed to help me improve my coding skills and tackle coding problems daily.

## Learning STL and Codeforces Practice
##  Day 1 : 29 Aug 2023 <br>

#### Submission Link for Codeforces :-
I tried two questions but I wasn't able to successfully submit the soln but soon I will try to fix the errors <br>
- [Submission Link](https://codeforces.com/submissions/GautamMehani) <br> 
Individual submission link <br> 
- [Sequence Game](https://codeforces.com/contest/1862/submission/221007003)<br>
- [Good Arrays](https://codeforces.com/contest/1856/submission/220942840)<br>

Watched 5 informative lectures on the Standard Template Library (STL) from the LUV YouTube channel
  - 1st was basic overview of stl containers and algorithms
  - 2nd and 3rd was implementation of vector, pairs, vector of vector, pair of pair, vector of     pairs
  - 4th was about iterators basics
  - 5th was about iterators using auto keyword

Here is the link of code which I practised to learn vector and pairs I put all the things which I already knew or which I learned today <br>

## Day 2 : 30 Aug 2023 <br>

Watched next two lectures of STL i.e. L-6 and L-7 of STL bu LUV YouTube channel and learned maps, unordered_map, and multi maps
Here is the link in which I practised map container in STL and celebrated Rakshabandhan festival.

## Day 3 : 31 Aug 2023 <br>
Watched next two lectures of STL i.e. L-7 and L-8 of STL bu LUV YouTube channel and learned set, unordered_set, and multiset 
Here is the link in which I practised set in STL. <br>
