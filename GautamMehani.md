# GAUTAM MEHANI - Vision 15 Days of Code Log

Welcome to my 15-day coding challenge! This challenge is designed to help me improve my coding skills and tackle coding problems daily.

## Learning [STL](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLauivoElc3gh3RCiQA82MDI-gJfXQQVnn&si=h_WPJhHIPX6WYbZb) and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/GautamMehani) Practice
##  Day 1 : 29 Aug 2023 <br>

#### Submission Link for Codeforces :-
I tried two questions but I wasn't able to successfully submit the soln but soon I will try to fix the errors <br>
- [Submission Link](https://codeforces.com/submissions/GautamMehani) <br> 
Individual submission link <br>

Watched 5 informative lectures on the Standard Template Library (STL) from the LUV YouTube channel
  - 1st was basic overview of stl containers and algorithms
  - 2nd and 3rd was implementation of vector, pairs, vector of vector, pair of pair, vector of     pairs
  - 4th was about iterators basics
  - 5th was about iterators using auto keyword

Here is the link of code which I practised to learn vector and pairs I put all the things which I already knew or which I learned today <br>

## Day 8 : 05 Sep 2023 <br>
#### First of all Happy Teachers Day...
Watched next  lectures of STL i.e. L-14, L-15 and L-16  of STL by LUV YouTube channel which was about intro sort which is widely used algorithm in STL and used comparator function to customise sorting. And finding lower_bound and upper_bound in any STL container<br> <br>
Here is the link in which I practised intro sort, comparator function and lower_bound & upper_bound. <br>
- [IntroSort](https://pastebin.com/LJChnLpa)<br>
- [ComparatorFunction](https://pastebin.com/zB5HnUJJ)<br>

## Day 9 : 06 Sep 2023 <br>
Krishna Janmashtmi was celebrated in our college therefore I couldn't code much today. <br>


## Day 10 : 07 Sep 2023 <br>

Watched next  lecture of STL i.e. L-17 and L-18 of STL by LUV YouTube channel which was about algorithms used like finding min and max elements, accumulate and reverse in STL <br> <br>
Given Codeforces Round 895 Div. 3 contest link is below : <br>

Tried second question using multimap but LUV sir given solution using vector of pair and set that is why my answer got partially accepted 1 test case passed then I optimised then 2 test case passed

## Day 13 : 10 Sep 2023 <br>

Tried to solve que Sequence Game in which it was throwing error on Day 1 in test case 1 with same logic I found error in my code by dry run and then I submitted again but in TestCase 5 it is showing an error of TLE here is the link <br>
- [Sequence Game](https://codeforces.com/contest/1862/submission/222703564)<br>

Given Codeforces Div2 contest and submitted B Question in which 2 pretest are passed<br>
- [2D Travelling](https://codeforces.com/contest/1869/submission/222799404)<br>

## Day 14 : 11 Sep 2023 <br>
Today I have headache so I couldn't practised much questions but tried MakeItZero que:A of above contest<br>
- [MakeAllZero](https://codeforces.com/contest/1869/submission/222988097)<br>


## Day 15 : 12 Sep 2023 <br>

Today I had tried 800 rating question of Codeforces but tried some different logic instead of giving bruteforce solution <br>
Submission links for todays que<br>
- [Array Coloring](https://codeforces.com/contest/1857/submission/223111286)<br>
- [Tales of Sort](https://codeforces.com/contest/1856/submission/223116086)<br>
- [Desorting](https://codeforces.com/contest/1853/submission/223121844)<br>



### Thanks to the team vision for organising such Vision 15 days of code log !!!<br>
In these 15 days I had learned about STL(Standard Template Library in C++)
Also I have explored codeforces and appeared in contests of both Div2 and Div3 and enhanced my rating from 0 to 729
These contest given me compititive environment and problems which are really good and based on example on real life in which we have to submit code within time.<br>
### I hope I will continue same hardwork for upcoming days.
